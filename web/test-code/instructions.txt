The task
--------

Display a list of widgets by letter.  Initially the user will be shown the
alphabet (A-Z and Other).  When they click one of the letters they will be
shown a list of all of the widgets which start with that letter.  If they click
"Other" they will be shown a list of the widgets which start with anything other
than A-Z.

Your tools

The source of the widgets is the SlowService class.  It's slow and unreliable
though, so you need to work around that somehow.  It's also likely that other
parts of the system will want to display the Widgets too, so coming up with a
reusable way to do that would be handy.

All of your new code should live in /app/Widgets.

The controller code lives in /app/Widget/actions.  The controller class is there
already, you just need to add in the code to make it do something.  The view
templates live in /app/Widget/templates.  Looking at the WidgetController class
should make it clear how they work.

There's a WidgetTask class there already too, in case you want to run a
scheduled task.

If you put a class file into /app/Widgets/lib then you can assume that the
framework will take care of its autoloading.

You have the following classes to help you:

Database
FastCache
Logger

If you want to create any database tables, please put the CREATE statements into
app/Widgets/data/database.sql.  They should work with MySQL 5.*
